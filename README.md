# Presentation Introduction AI

This is a light introduction of AI, Artificial Intelligence, by [Marc van Andel](https://github.com/marcvanandel). This is currently being constructed - in Dutch only (for now).

This is a slide deck produced with [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), a HTML presentation framework, so it can be viewed with a browser.

Presentations are available via Github Pages on https://marcvanandel.github.io/pressi-introduction-ai/
